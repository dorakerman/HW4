Question 1:
We believe that manually it would have taken us around 1 hour  to do so, using google chrome.
If we had to count manually, it would've taken us 4 hours.

Question 2:
We have come to a conclusion that writing this sort of program can save us time, blood, sweat and tears.
We can use the concept on every search and count task the resolves many files or a lot of text.

Question 3:
If we would like to run this script every hour, we can create a different script that knows how to count time,
and every hour it runs the script.
Also, we should create a list of all the links we have searched and after creating the new list of files we should delete the links that appear in both files.
